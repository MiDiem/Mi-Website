<h1>Interests in IT</h1>
<p>My interest of IT started when I was in year 9 when I picked multimedia as a subject. I thought multimedia was interesting, so I picked Information technology as a year 9 elective for the second semester. I thought that making a website was fascinating and that was when my interest in IT officially started. I also loved computer and computer games at the time and was obsessed with the game League of Legends. At that time, I wanted to be a game coder or creator, but I guess things changed. It changed because I saw the huge amount of job losses at the time, and I decided to switch to business as I wanted to do a job related to Marketing. Although I was in the marketing field, I felt like do I really want to be doing this all my life? Or do I want to do something more different. I couldn’t handle those feelings anymore and I decided I’ll follow my dreams and start studying IT again although I would have to start from scratch at first year again.</p>
<p>Family played a huge role in my interest in IT when I was younger as majority of my aunts and uncles were working in the IT field. I saw that that they made good money and I wanted a job that pays a lot like theirs. In It you can work at home or in an office and this flexibility also sparked my interest in IT again after the global pandemic. I made a website in high school, and I also have experiences in making databases on Excel with queries. My favourite IT project was making a game back in high school because it was pretty satisfying for someone who loves computer games like me. We used Java to code the project. I thought it was interesting how we can just code and command a computer to do certain tasks. It was just a game with a race car running around in loops and we followed the instructions of a textbook to make it.</p>
<P>I chose to come to RMIT because it was at a convenient location. RMIT is basically in the heart of the CBD. It is also ranked in top 5 universities in Melbourne and has the best facilities. I went to RMIT Open Day and decided that this would be university choice as it was so convenient to access everything including Melbourne’s best cafés and attractions such as Melbourne Central. </P>
<p>During my studies I expect to learn how to make a better website and how to analyse data. I expect to develop my knowledge even further and gain experience working in an IT team after this course ends so I can put it on my resume or CV.</p>

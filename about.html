        <p>Hi, my name is Mi and I’m born in Melbourne and I am currently studying Bachelor of Business. My nationality is Vietnamese, and I can speak it fluently. Besides Vietnamese, I can speak basic Italian. I have 2 dogs and I love sports. Sports and business were my best subjects in school. I like to listen to music and dance with my friends to relive stress. I like to play League of Legends, Valorant and PUBG. People often confuse the pronunciation of my name and sometimes it can be funny. My name is Mi and it’s pronounced as Me. The unique thing about me is when I taste food, I can tell what ingredients were put in there.</p>
        
        <p>
            Besides gaming, I like to go out with my friends and family to eat and go shopping. I love watching cooking shows such as My Kitchen Rules. My favourite TV show used to be XFactor and now I just like watching travel vlogs. My favourite YouTuber would be MrBeast as he is always giving away expensive things for his fans. I would really like to go to the Backstreet Boys or Blackpink concert one day with my best friend and I heard they are both coming to Melbourne next year.

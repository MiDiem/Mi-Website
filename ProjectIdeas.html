<h1>Project Ideas</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The app will be a job seeking app available in different languages and employers won’t need to pay but they will need to verify that their business is legit. It will be created using visual code studio and will be available on all smartphone platforms. This job seeking app will also let employees’ post rosters and anyone with the relevant skills and qualifications can accept the job. This will help job seekers and employers find vacancies and staff faster. The job seekers on the app can accept jobs instantly at their convenience. It includes short paid tasks for people who don’t like shift work. </p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Jobs play a huge part in our Australian economy and the unemployment rate has been the lowest this year. Almost a quarter of Australian businesses are low on staff while some people struggle to find work. I want to grow Australia’s economy so therefore I want to create a job seeking app that makes it easy for employers to find employees. It will also make it easy for migrants with no English to find jobs that don’t require English. Business owners with limited English also find it hard to find employees and this app would be a benefit for both.

</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The job seekers will need to submit their degrees if they have one. Like stated in the overview, companies will need to submit their Australian Business Number on the app. It will come up with error if the ABN doesn’t exist and all details of the name must be correct. This will ensure people who use the app don’t get scammed. The app will also have freelance work where you can accept shifts that are relevant to your skills and qualifications. The app will currently only be available in Australia and only people with an Australian IP address can access it.

</p>

<p>Unlike Seek, employers cannot post jobs unless they have proof that their business is real. They will also need to prove that the business is real and show a statement with the address and company name. This way job seekers and employers won’t get scammed like my friend who went for a job interview advertised on Seek that asked her to pay for a certificate. 

</p>

<p>When you start the app, you will need to choose your preferred language as not all business owners can speak or read English. The jobseekers will be able to find jobs or projects related to the language they have chosen. Jobseekers can add in an option to show jobs that require other languages if they prefer. It will match the business culture type with the employee’s culture type if they don’t know English. This is a benefit for the vulnerable people in Australia who are unemployed and unable to learn English. Small business often has nonspeaking English employees, and this can also help them as it can help them find employees from further areas of Australia. 

</p>

<p>Employers must also state how much they pay per hour to ensure that employees are paid fairly from the app. On Seek, there are still jobs that underpay people, and this is not great at all. My app will not allow this as employers will have to pay their employees using this app too. This app will have great flexibility for people who want to earn money at their own pace too as they can accept projects such as designing a logo for a business and get paid. Users will get rewards such as vouchers when they accept a job to increase user rates.

</p>

<p>The app can be used for when a business is short on staff due to people been sick. A person with the relevant degree will be assigned to the employer. The app will show the employee’s information to the employer. The person just enters the job they want, and they’ll be automatically matched, and it will only show them results in the industries they like. They can turn on suggestions if they are interested in jobs in a different industry. Employers can also find applicants in process of a degree and train them while paying them lower rates then a qualified person. This is both beneficial for the employee and students looking to gain paid experience. 

</p>

<h2>Tools and Technology</h2>
<p>The coding tool used for this project would be Visual Studio Code. The HTML programming language will present the content and CSS will be used to help change the presentation such as colours and images on the app. The windows 11 hardware computer hardware will be used for Android. Technology such as social media will also be needed in this project idea to help advertise and launch the app. Canva will also be a tool used to create a unique logo for the app. A Mac Computer will also be needed and XCode for the programs to run on Apple devices. 

</p>

<h2>Skills Required</h2>
<p>The skills required for this project would be programming skills. I would need to have knowledge on how to use html and CSS on Visual Studio Code. I would need to know how to add colours, images and buttons to the program. I would need to know how to publish and launch the app on the Android and Apple platforms. Designing skills will also be a skill requirement for this project. Good communication skills and analytical skills are also crucial as the team will need to report a fault and find a solution before the app launches to the public.

</p>

<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>If the project is successful, the app will be in the top downloaded apps in Australia in both Android and the App Store. More people will prefer this app over Seek as they won’t have to go through many interviews. The unemployment rate will drop from 3.5% to at least 2% within a year. It will help businesses run like before the pandemic. 	This development will have a huge impact on the economy. The economy will go up and Australia won’t have delays at supermarkets or during the logistics process as they will have enough staff to serve our population.
